       "'Animal Kingdom \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n1.\\nAnimal Kingdom \\nINTRODUCTION\\nThere is a vast diversity in the number and types \\nof animals in nature. They range from unicellular \\nto multicellular. They are found in the deepest \\nof the oceans, in snow-covered mountains, from \\nthe poles to the equator. There are differences in \\nthe structure and forms of the different animals. \\nBut there are some fundamental features in them \\nwhich show resemblance such as arrangement \\nof cells, body plan, symmetry, segmentation, \\ncoelom, germ layer, body temperature, skeleton \\nand notochord, types of digestive, respiratory, \\ncirculatory, excretory, and reproductive systems.\\nWe need to classify organisms to make our study \\neasier and to study the interrelationship between \\ndifferent groups.\\nBASES OF CLASSIFICATION\\nHabitat\\n\\t\\ny\\nOn the basis of habitat, animals are divided into \\nthe following types:\\n\\t\\n⚪\\nAquatic-Organisms that are found in water. \\nThey can be: \\n\\t\\n\\x90\\nMarine-Echinoderms, many sponges and \\ncoelenterates. \\n\\t\\n\\x90\\nFresh water-Prawns, some fishes and \\nmolluscs.\\n\\t\\n⚪\\nTerrestrial-Organisms that are found on land. \\nThey can be:\\n\\t\\n\\x90\\nFossorial animals (found in burrows) - \\nEarthworm, snake, rabbit.\\n\\t\\n\\x90\\nArboreal (found on trees) - Birds, bats, \\nmonkeys.\\n\\t\\n\\x90\\nScansorial (climb the walls) - House \\nlizards, squirrels.\\nGray Matter Alert!!!\\nMarine phyla: Phylum \\nEchinodermata, \\nCtenophora and phylum Hemichordata are \\nthree exclusively marine phyla.\\nAnimal Kingdom \\nAnimal Kingdom – Characteristics of Classification\\n\\n2.\\nAnimal Kingdom – Characteristics of Classification \\nLevels of Organisation\\n\\t\\ny\\nAnimals are divided into five types, on the basis \\nof their level of organisation:\\n\\t\\n⚪\\nProtoplasmic level of organisation: A cellular \\nbody performs all the biological activities.\\nExample: Protozoa\\n\\t\\n⚪\\nCellular level of organisation: The cells of \\nthe body are present in loose aggregates and \\ntogether perform all the functions. \\nExample: Sponges\\n\\t\\n⚪\\nTissue level of organisation: The cells of the \\norganism unite together to form a tissue \\nsystem which helps the organism to perform \\ndifferent functions. \\nExample: Coelenterata\\n\\t\\n⚪\\nOrgan level of organisation: The tissues \\ncombine together to form organs which \\nperform different functions.\\nExample: Platyhelminthes\\n\\t\\n⚪\\nOrgan-system level of organisation: The \\norgans of an organism combine together to \\nform different organ-systems which help in \\nthe functioning of the whole organism. \\nExamples: Aschelminthes to Chordata.\\nSymmetry \\nIt is the arrangement of the body organs on either \\nside of the main axis of the body. It is of two \\ntypes – Asymmetry and symmetry.\\n\\t\\ny\\nAsymmetry: When the body of an organism \\ncannot be divided into two identical halves in any \\nplane. \\nExamples: In some sponges and snails.\\n\\t\\ny\\nSymmetry: When the body of an organism can be \\ndivided into two identical halves in one or more \\nplanes. On the basis of the plane involved, it is of \\ntwo types:\\n\\t\\n⚪\\nRadial: \\n\\t\\n\\x90\\nWhen the body of an organism can be \\ndivided into two identical halves by any \\n\\n3.\\nAnimal Kingdom – Characteristics of Classification \\nplane passing through the central axis of \\nthe body.\\n\\t\\n\\x90\\nFor sessile animals, radial symmetry was \\nuseful as it helped them in food gathering \\nfrom all sides. They might have developed \\nappendages all around to capture the prey. \\nExamples: Coelenterates, Ctenophores, \\nEchinoderms\\n\\t\\n⚪\\nBilateral: \\n\\t\\n\\x90\\nWhen the body of an organism can be \\ndivided into two identical halves by only \\none plane, passing through the longitudinal \\naxis of the body.\\n\\t\\n\\x90\\nIt arose when animals on the ocean floor \\nbecame mobile. A crawling animal will \\nencounter food with the end that moves \\nfirst. \\n\\t\\n\\x90\\nSo, mouth developed at this end. Sensory \\norgans and a coordinating brain developed \\nat the front end. \\n\\t\\n\\x90\\nThese organs helped in sensing food. So, \\nthe head enclosing the brain became \\nassociated with the mouth end. This is \\ncephalization. \\nExamples: Annelids, Arthropods. \\n\\n4.\\nAnimal Kingdom – Characteristics of Classification \\nBody Plan\\nAnimals show three different types of body plan:\\n\\t\\ny\\nCell aggregate plan: In this case, the body is just \\nan aggregate of cells. \\nExample: Sponges\\n\\t\\ny\\nBlind sac plan: In this case, the multicellular \\norganism has tissue or organ level of organisation. \\nThe organism has only one opening for intake of \\nfood as well as it is through this pore, the waste \\nis thrown out of the body. \\nExample: Platyhelminthes\\n\\t\\ny\\nTube within the tube plan: In this case, the body \\nconsists of two tubes. One tube is formed by \\nthe wall of the body and the second is formed \\nby the digestive tract. It has two openings. One \\nat the anterior for intake of food and the other \\nat the posterior end for egestion of undigested \\nfood. It is of two types – Protostomes and \\nDeuterostomes.\\n\\n5.\\nAnimal Kingdom – Characteristics of Classification \\n\\t\\n⚪\\nProtostomes: ‘Proto’ means first and ‘stoma’ \\nmeans mouth. Thus, in protostome organisms, \\nthe development of the mouth in the embryo \\ntakes place first followed by the anus. \\t\\n \\nExamples: Platyhelminthes, Aschelminthes, \\nAnnelida, Mollusca\\n\\t\\n⚪\\nDeuterostomes: ‘Deutero’ means second, and \\n‘stoma’ means mouth. Thus, in deuterostome \\norganisms, the development of the anus takes \\nplace first and development of mouth in the \\nembryo takes place after it. \\nExamples: \\nEchinodermata, \\nHemichordata, \\nChordata\\nGerm Layers\\nThe layer of the gastrula which gives rise to the \\ndifferent parts of the body is called the germ \\nlayers. On the basis of the number of the layers, \\nthere are two categories:\\n\\t\\ny\\nDiploblastic: Two germ layers i.e., ectoderm and \\nendoderm give rise to the different parts of the \\nbody. In between the two layers is present a non-\\ncellular layer known as mesoglea.\\nExamples: Sponges, Coelenterate, Ctenophores \\nDefinition\\nCephalization: Differentiation of \\nhead at the anterior end during \\nembryonic development.\\nDefinitions\\nProtostomes: \\nOrganisms \\nin \\nwhich the mouth is developed \\nfirst in the embryo, followed by \\nthe anus.\\nExamples: \\nPlanaria, \\nAscaris, \\nearthworm, Pila, wasp\\nDeuterostomes: Organisms in \\nwhich the anus develops first \\nin the embryo, followed by the \\nmouth.\\nExamples: \\nStarfish, \\nBalanoglossus, \\nrohu, \\nsnake, \\npigeon, deer\\n\\n6.\\nAnimal Kingdom – Characteristics of Classification \\n\\t\\ny\\nTriploblastic: Three germ layers i.e., ectoderm, \\nmesoderm and endoderm give rise to the \\ndifferent parts of the body. Examples: Flatworm \\nto mammals\\nSegmentation\\nSegmentation is the division of a body into \\nportions known as segments. It is of four types:\\n\\t\\ny\\nMetameric segments (True segmentation): The \\nbody is divided into segments; internally and \\nexternally. \\nExample: Annelida \\n\\t\\ny\\nExternal Segmentation- Arthropoda \\n\\t\\ny\\nInternal Segmentation- Chordata\\n\\t\\ny\\nPseudometameric \\nsegments \\n(False \\nsegmentation): The segments of the body are not \\nformed from the embryo and thus are known as \\npseudometamerism. \\nExample: Tape worm\\nPrevious Year’s Question\\nWhich one of the following kinds \\nof animals are triploblastic?\\n(1)\\t Flatworms \\n(2)\\tSponges \\n(3)\\tCtenophores \\n(4)\\tCorals\\n\\n7.\\nAnimal Kingdom – Characteristics of Classification \\nCoelom\\nThe space between the body wall and the gut wall \\nis known as coelom. On the basis of the nature \\nof coelom, organisms are of the following types: \\n\\t\\ny\\nAcoelomates: Organisms do not have any cavity \\nor coelom and thus are called as acoelomates. \\nExamples: Platyhelminthes, porifera, \\ncoelenterata, ctenophora \\n\\t\\ny\\nPseudocoelomates: The mesoderm is present in \\nform of small pouches between the ectoderm \\nand endoderm. \\nExample: Aschelminthes\\n\\n8.\\nAnimal Kingdom – Characteristics of Classification \\n\\t\\ny\\nCoelomates (Eucoelomates): It is a body cavity \\nwhich arises from the mesoderm. It is of three \\ntypes:\\n\\t\\n⚪\\nSchizocoelom: It develops due to the split in \\nthe mesoderm sheet. \\nExamples: Arthropods, molluscs, annelids\\n\\t\\n⚪\\nEnterocoelom: The mesoderm arises from \\nthe wall of the embryonic gut as a hollow \\noutgrowth and forms the coelom. \\nExamples: Echinoderms, chordates\\n\\t\\n⚪\\nHaemocoelomates: \\nIn \\nArthropods \\nand \\nMolluscs, the true coelom is reduced and \\nfilled with blood and known as haemocoel. \\nDefinition\\nPseudocoelomate: \\nIn \\nthese \\norganisms, mesoderm is present \\nin \\nform \\nof \\nsmall \\npouches \\nin between the two layers \\nectoderm and endoderm.\\n\\n9.\\nAnimal Kingdom – Characteristics of Classification \\nSkeleton\\nThe framework of the body that gives shape and \\nprotection to the animals is known as skeleton. \\nIt is of two types on the basis of their position:\\n\\t\\ny\\nEndoskeleton: Hard structure that is present \\ninside the body.\\nExamples: Bones present inside the body, like \\nhumans.\\n\\t\\ny\\nExoskeleton: It is present outside the body. It is \\nof different types like-\\n\\t\\n⚪\\nCalcareous shells in Mollusca.\\n\\t\\n⚪\\nEpidermal scales in reptiles.\\n\\t\\n⚪\\nFeathers in birds.\\n\\t\\n⚪\\nHair, nails, claws, horns in mammals.\\nNotochord \\nIt is a solid, unjointed and mesodermal rod, \\npresent on the dorsal side of the body. Depending \\nupon its presence or absence, there are two \\ngroups of animals:\\n\\t\\ny\\nNon-Chordates: Organisms that do not have the \\nnotochord are known as non-chordates. \\nExamples: Poriferans to Hemichordates\\n\\n10.\\nAnimal Kingdom – Characteristics of Classification \\n\\t\\ny\\nChordates: Organisms that have the notochord \\nare known as chordates. \\nExamples: Pisces to mammals\\nCleavage\\nIt is of two types:\\n\\t\\ny\\nMosaic \\n(Determinate) \\nCleavage: \\nComplete \\nembryo is formed from the whole blastomere. If \\nany of the blastomere gets detached accidentally \\nthen the embryo formation will cease.\\nExample: Annelids\\n\\t\\ny\\nNon-Mosaic (Non-determinate) Cleavage: On \\nseparation of some of the blastomeres in the \\nearly stage, the leftover blastomeres will give \\nrise to the complete embryo.\\nExample: Chordates\\nDevelopment\\n\\t\\ny\\nIndirect: The young one does not resemble the \\nparent. It undergoes metamorphosis through a \\nnumber of larval or nymphal stages to develop \\ninto an adult.\\nExamples: Mosquito, frog, tape worm \\nDefinition\\nNotochord: A solid, unjointed \\nmesodermal rod present on \\nthe dorsal side of the body. In \\nsome animals, it develops into a \\nvertebral column in later stages \\nof their life.\\nKeywords\\n\\t\\n\\x8a Diploblastic     \\n\\t\\n\\x8a Triploblastic\\n\\t\\n\\x8a Coelomate\\n\\t\\n\\x8a Pseudocoelomate\\n\\t\\n\\x8a Protostomes\\n\\t\\n\\x8a Deuterostomes\\n\\n11.\\nAnimal Kingdom – Characteristics of Classification \\n\\t\\ny\\nDirect: The young one resembles the adult and it \\ndoes not undergo metamorphosis.\\nExamples: Humans, birds \\nTypes of Eggs\\nBased on the quantity of yolk, they are of three \\ntypes: \\n\\t\\ny\\nMicrolecithal: The amount of yolk in the egg is \\nless. \\nExamples: Eggs of Herdmania, Sea Urchin\\n\\t\\ny\\nMesolecithal: The amount of yolk in the egg is \\nmoderate. \\nExamples: Eggs of frog, fish, toad\\n\\t\\ny\\nMacrolecithal: The amount of yolk in the egg is \\nhigh. \\nExamples: Eggs of birds, reptiles, bony fishes.\\nBased on the distribution of yolk in the cytoplasm \\nof egg, they are of three types:\\n\\t\\n⚪\\nHomolecithal: Yolk is uniformly distributed. \\nExamples: \\nEggs \\nof \\nAnnelids, \\nmolluscs, \\nprotochordates\\n\\t\\n⚪\\nTelolecithal: Yolk is concentrated in the \\nvegetal half. \\nExamples: Eggs of Amphibians\\n\\t\\n⚪\\nMeiolecithal: Yolk is present in the entire \\nooplasm, except for a little disc-shaped space \\nin the cytoplasm for the nucleus.\\nExamples: Eggs of Reptiles\\nDefinition\\nMetamorphosis: \\nDrastic \\nchanges through which the larva \\nof an organism, structurally and \\nmorphologically modifies into \\nthe adult.\\nExamples: \\nDevelopment \\nof \\nbutterfly and frog \\n\\n12.\\nAnimal Kingdom – Characteristics of Classification \\n\\t\\n⚪\\nCentrolecithal: Yolk is present in the centre \\nof the cell. \\nExamples: Eggs of insects\\nBody Temperature\\nOn the basis of body temperature, organisms are \\nof two types:\\n\\t\\ny\\nHomeotherms (Warm-blooded animals): The \\nbody temperature does not change with the \\nchange in ambient temperature. \\nExamples: Birds, mammals.\\n\\t\\ny\\nPoikilotherms (Cold-blooded animals): The body \\ntemperature changes with the change in the \\nambient temperature. \\nExamples: Amphibians, pisces, reptiles\\nDigestion\\nBased on where the digestion takes place, it is \\ndivided into two types:\\n\\t\\ny\\nIntracellular: Digestion takes place within the \\ncells of the body. \\nExamples: Amoeba\\nPrevious Year’s Question\\nTemperature \\nchanges \\nin \\nthe \\nenvironment affect most of the \\nanimals which are\\n(1)\\t poikilothermic \\n(2)\\thomeothermic  \\n(3)\\taquatic \\n(4)\\tdesert living\\n\\n13.\\nAnimal Kingdom – Characteristics of Classification \\n\\t\\ny\\nExtracellular: Digestion takes place outside the \\ncell, in a cavity of an organ. \\nExamples: Hydra\\nDigestive System\\nIt is of two types:\\n\\t\\ny\\nIncomplete: A single opening that functions both \\nas a mouth and anus. \\nExample: Platyhelminthes\\n\\t\\ny\\nComplete: Two openings, i.e. mouth and anus are \\npresent.\\nExamples: Arthropoda, annelida, aschelminthes, \\nchordata \\nRespiration\\nOrganisms follow two modes of respiration:\\n\\t\\ny\\nAerobic respiration: Organisms respire in the \\npresence of oxygen. \\nExamples: Mammals, reptiles, coelenterates\\n\\t\\ny\\nAnaerobic respiration: Organisms respire in the \\nabsence of oxygen.\\nExample: Flatworms\\nDefinitions\\nAerobic Respiration: Respiration \\nthat occurs in the presence of \\noxygen.

It is a single \\nlayer of cells which are polygonal in shape, \\nknown as pinacocytes. \\n\\t\\n\\x90\\nPinacocytes have nucleus in the center.\\n\\t\\n\\x90\\nThe cells show contractility, which helps \\nthe sponges to increase and decrease in \\nsize.\\n\\t\\n\\x90\\nThis layer also contains tubular cells \\nknown as pore cells or porocytes.

The attachment of the wings higher up \\nin the body; presence of lighter body organs on \\nthe above and heavy muscles below it helps it in \\nflight.\\n\\t\\ny\\nFeathers: They are light and cover the body. \\n\\n80.\\nChordata\\nFeathers are  directed backward which help \\nthe bird to shear the friction and fly ahead. The \\nfeathers also help in maintaining the temperature \\nof the body at high altitudes. \\n\\t\\ny\\nModification of limbs: Forelimbs are modified \\ninto wings and help in flying. The shape of the \\nwings helps to reduce air pressure above and \\nincreases air pressure below the body. Thus, \\nhelping in flight.\\n\\t\\ny\\nShort tail: The short tail acts as a rudder in \\nchanging direction during flight and to check \\nflight.\\n\\t\\ny\\nEndoskeleton: The presence of hollow bones \\nwhich help the body to be light in weight. The \\nbones are light as they are filled by air spaces \\nand not bone marrow.\\n\\t\\ny\\nAir sac: They are attached to the lungs and \\nprovide extra support to the bird for respiration \\nduring flying and help in internal perspiration of \\nthe bird, thus maintaining body temperature.\\n\\t\\ny\\nWarm-blooded: This provides them greater \\nenergy for the flight.\\nClassification of Aves\\n\\t\\ny\\nAves are classified into two subclasses.\\n\\t\\n⚪\\nSubclass Archaeornithes: Extinct, toothed \\nbeak, long tail, low  power of flight.
